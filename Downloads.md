**Please download from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pcaspy) for version 0.5.0 and above.**

The reason is that [Google deprecated Download Service](http://google-opensource.blogspot.ro/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html). This isn't bad for a Python package. Using PyPI makes the deployment much easier!
